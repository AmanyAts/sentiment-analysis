## Implementation Details

This document provides a detailed explanation of the implementation of the GPU-accelerated sentiment analysis project.

### Project Objectives
1. Efficiently preprocess, tokenize, and analyze large datasets for sentiment classification.
2. Leverage GPU programming to accelerate computationally expensive tasks.
3. Compare implementations using CUDA Python, CUDA C/C++, and OpenACC.

### Parallelization Strategies

#### 1. CUDA Python
- **Tokenization**:
  - A custom CUDA kernel processes each row of text in parallel, identifying token boundaries efficiently.
  - The kernel maps characters to token indices, reducing preprocessing bottlenecks.
- **Model Training**:
  - Uses cuDF and cuML libraries for Logistic Regression.
  - Training data is kept in GPU memory to minimize data transfer overhead.

#### 2. CUDA C/C++
- **Dense Layer Computation**:
  - A 2D grid of threads handles matrix-vector multiplications for the dense layer.
- **Sigmoid Activation**:
  - Threads compute activation for individual outputs, minimizing memory transfer overhead.

#### 3. OpenACC
- Simplifies the implementation of GPU parallelism with compiler directives.
- Handles tokenization and preprocessing tasks with reduced code complexity compared to CUDA.

### Optimizations
- **Memory Management**:
  - Reduced CPU-GPU transfers by processing data entirely in GPU memory.
  - Allocated memory efficiently using `cudaMalloc` and similar techniques.
- **Kernel Fusion**:
  - Combined kernels for preprocessing and tokenization to reduce overhead.
- **Profiling and Tuning**:
  - Used NVIDIA Nsight Systems and NVTX annotations to identify bottlenecks and optimize kernel performance.
